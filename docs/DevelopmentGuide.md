## üìñ Introduction
The MLB Portal application is built with a `SPA (Single Page Application)` architecture on the client side (frontend). A `SPA` is a web application which only loads a single HTML file and updates the content dynamically using JavaScript instead of loading entire pages from the server. This SPA was developed using `Angular 20`.

On the server side of the application (backend), it was developed with `Spring Boot`, providing a `REST API` as the communciation method between the server and the client.

For the data management, the application uses a `MySQL` database.

As it can be seen, the architecture of the application is `monolithic` divided into two main layers:
- **Client (frontend)** --> Angular.
- **Server (backend)** --> Srping Boot exposing a REST API, and a MySQL database.

## üíª Technologies
The application uses the following technologies for its execution:

### Frontend
- **Node.js:** Execution environment for JavaScript on the server side, allowing JavaScript code to run outside the browser. For more information, consult the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).
- **npm:** The official package manager for Node.js. For more information, consult the [npm official website](https://www.npmjs.com).
- **Angular:** Framework for developing web applications on the frontend, enabling the creation of Single Page Applications (SPAs). For more information, consult the [Angular official website](https://angular.dev).

### Backend
- **Maven:** Build and dependency management tool for Java projects. For more information, consult the [Maven official website](https://maven.apache.org/).
- **Spring Boot:** Backend framework for developing Java web applications and REST APIs. For more information, consult the [Spring official website](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). Main modules:
  - **Spring MVC:** To develop web applications and controllers.
  - **Spring Data:** To interact with the database.
  - **Spring Security:**  For authentication and authorization.
- **MySQL:** Database used to store and manage the application data. For more information, consult the [MySQL official website](https://www.mysql.com/).

## üîß Tools
The following IDEs and auxiliary tools were used during the development of the application:

### IDEs
- **Visual Studio Code:** Lightweight open-source code editor with support for extensions. It was used for developing of both frontend and backend side of the application.

### Auxiliary Tools
- **REST Client:** Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to send HTTP requests and view responses directly within the editor
- **Git:** A distributed version control system used to track changes in the source code during the software development process.
- **GitHub:** A cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration features for developers. Inside of it, we can find:
  - **GitHub Actions:** Used for the CI process.
  - **GitHub Projects:** Helps organize the tasks in a Kanban board view.
- **Jacoco:** Is a Java code coverage library used to measure how much of your code is executed during the automated tests.
- **Docker Desktop**: TBD.
