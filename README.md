## ‚öæ Application Functionality
The app is a portal dedicated to Major League Baseball (MLB), offering general league information, as well as detailed information on teams, players, standings, and other relevant aspects.

In addition to these basic functions, users can register to access exclusive features, such as purchasing tickets for their favorite games, selecting favorite teams to customize the information displayed, and the ability to enable or disable email notifications with the latest league news from their profile.

The platform also has administrator users, responsible for the internal management of the app, including updating information on teams, players, and other content.

The main objective of this app is to offer baseball fans a comprehensive and up-to-date space to follow MLB and the performance of their favorite teams throughout the season.

At this time, the functional and technical objectives are only defined but not implemented.

## üìù Methodology
The development of the application will be divided in different phases, which are:

### Phase 1: Features and Screens Specification
**Start Date:** June 26

**Due Date:** September 15

**Real End Date:** TBD

The application features will be defined and categorized as basic, intermediate, or advanced. Alongside this, an initial overview of the screens will be provided, specifying their purpose, transitions, and navigation flow. 

Additionally, the entities and their relationships will be defined, as well as the different user types and their corresponding permissions within the application.

### Phase 2: Repository, Tests and CI
**Start Date:** TBD

**Due Date:** October 15

**Real End Date:** TBD

In this phase, the repository will be created along with the basic implementation required to connect the client, the server and the database. Furthermore, the first automated tests will be implemented and the Continous Integration (CI) system will be configured.

### Phase 3: Version 0.1 - Basic Features and Docker
**Start Date:** TBD

**Due Date:** December 15

**Real End Date:** TBD

The basic features will be implemented along with their corresponding automated tests, and the application will be packaged using Docker (adding Continous Delivery). Finally, the 0.1 version will be released.

This phase will follow an **iterative and incremental development process**, meaning that the application will be built in small parts or increments, with features gradually added until the application is complete. Each increment will be reviewed and refined through successive iterations.

>[!NOTE]
> This process will also be followed in phases 4 through 5.

### Phase 4: Version 0.2 - Intermediate Features
**Start Date:** TBD

**Due Date:** March 1

**Real End Date:** TBD

The intermediate features will be implemented along with their corresponding automated tests, and the application will also be packaged. Finally, the 0.2 version will be released.

### Phase 5: Version 1.0 - Advanced Features
**Start Date:** TBD

**Due Date:** April 15

**Real End Date:** TBD

The advanced features will be implemented along with their corresponding automated tests, and the application will also be packaged. At this stage, the application will be complete and the 1.0 version will be released.

### Phase 6: Report
**Start Date:** TBD

**Due Date:** May 15

**Real End Date:** TBD

The first draft of the report will be prepared.

### Phase 7: Defense of the Final Degree Project
**Start Date:** TBD

**Due Date:** June 15

**Real End Date:** TBD

The defense of the Final Degree Project will take place.

Below is a **Gantt Chart** that graphically reflects the planning mentioned above.

## üéØ Objectives

### Functionals
The main functional objective of this application is to offer baseball fans a complete and personalized portal for Major League Baseball (MLB), allowing them to have access to general league information, team and player data, standings and match results, as well as access interactive services such as purchasing tickets, personalizing content based on favorite teams, and allow the user to stay up to date on the latest that is happening around league by enabling email notifications.

#### Main Features
1. Display general MLB information, including standings and match results.
2. Display teams and players information.
3. Allow the users to sign-up and authenticate themselves to have access to exclusive services.
4. Allow the registered users to mark a team as a favourite.

> [!NOTE]
> In the [User Stories](#-user-stories) section you can find all of the features the application will provide.

### Technicals
The application will be developed as a web platform with a client-server architecture using the **HTTPS** protocol to ensure application security, data protection, and secure communication. 

The **backend** will be implemented with **Spring Boot** to manage the business logic, communication with the **MySQL database**, and the exposure of services through a REST API. 

The **frontend** will be implemented with **HTML, CSS (it`s being considered to use TailwindCSS), JavaScript, and Angular**, offering a responsive interface. The **ng2-charts** library will be integrated to display statistical data (charts).

**Postman** will be used during the development and testing of REST services, and the workflow will include version control with **Git**. Additionally, **Docker** will be used as part of the Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment processes, ensuring that the application can be built, packaged, tested, and deployed consistently across different environments. 

To ensure the software quality, unit and integration testing will be performed using **Mockito** and **AssertJ**, as well as system/end-to-end (e2e) testing using **Selenium**.

#### Main Technical Features
1. Spring Boot as the backend framework to implement the business logic and expose the REST API.
2. HTML, CSS (it`s being considered to use TailwindCSS), JavaScript and Angular to implement the frontend, ensuring a responsive interface.
3. ng2-charts library to display the statistical data (charts).
4. Data storage and management using a MySQL relational database.
5. Postman for designing and validating REST API endpoints.
6. Responsive design to ensure compatibility with mobile devices, tablets and computers.
7. Version control with Git.
8. Docker for application containerization as part of the Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment process.
9. Mockito and AssertJ for unit and integration testing.
10. Selenium for system/end-to-end (e2e) testing.
